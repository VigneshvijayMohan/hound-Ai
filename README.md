# Hound Chrome Extension with LLM Integration

A Chrome extension that allows users to select any text on a webpage and process it using AI. It sends the selected text and current URL to a Django backend integrated with Hugging Face models. The responseâ€”such as summaries, generated text, or context insightsâ€”is displayed in a floating bubble above the selected text.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Process selected text via right-click or toggle
